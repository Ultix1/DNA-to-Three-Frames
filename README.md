# FrameRL

### The point of this repository is to serve as a new home for our RL methodology.

This repository serves as the home of FrameRL. A DNA-to-Protein RL alignment method that aims to provide a novel solution while still making use of Zhang's Three Frame alignment technique

Future works include:
- PPO
- DDPG
- Imitation Learning (Inverse Reinforcement Learning)
- SAC
- A2C
- Soft Q Learning (Maybe not, we are not in a Stochastic Environment)
